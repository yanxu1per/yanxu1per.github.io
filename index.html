                    <p class="text-muted">We drafted an initial survey with the intention to have a digital version that could be used for a quantitative analysis, but quickly realized that this was unrealistic to disseminate the survey to these populations effectively. Trying to only gather data from populations who were able to use a digital survey would also add significant bias towards our result, skewed towards only trying to understand communities with increased access to technology and of mental capacity to effectively answer these questions.
For this reason, we decided that the survey would have to be conducted closer to an informal interview, in which the team filled out the survey for each individual as they answered somewhat structured questions. There is a fairly wide variation in the ways that these survey interviews were conducted, and we had to remain dynamic based on the individual.

              <p>Step out the confort zone</p>
              <p>I was assigned to two teammates who I barely knew, things in the beginning were hard, I found it hard to schedule anything with these two guys because we shared very different life style and work style. I met this situation for the first time in my whole life, and I could not withstand it so I sent a email asking for changing group. My instructor Linda talked to us. She nicely asked me to step out of my comfort zone, and I was shocked by her word and decided to never think of changing group. Later on, I started to enjoy the work style of our group and felt fitted well with the group. It was like, for example, OK, it's weekend, just leave the job there or we would like to submit an late but excellent job rather than a on-time mediocre job. We became good friends, I knew that these two gus came from small college where they were educated in the different way from those who came from giant university, so they enjoyed more in the process, for example, I clearly knew people would choose to make up the field study but we definitly won't do that, so one of our photos when we were conducting real field study on the homeless was shown on GIX facebook and becomes our precious memory. From that, I think I can work with people from different culture.</p>
              <p>Design Thinking Process</p>
              <p>I come from engineer background, so before the class, I only care if core technology is cutting-edge. After going through the whole process such as brainstorming, secondary research, field study, scenario designing, prototype and usability test, I think now I can think of designing a product from a different perspective. After this project, whatever project I do, I will first search online to find all the related materials to get a overall understanding, know success and failure of others and refine my thinking. Based on that, field study is necessary to get opinions from different perspectives, and we can get real feedbacks from it. With the secondary and primary research, we can feel more confident in designing scenarios and putting them in the storyboard is a fun way to think through it. The scenario designing process need to be refined with the usability test to make sure it's user-friendly and well accessible. The complete process is reliable, which gives me more than enough confidence in my next project.</p>
              <p>Went well</p>
              <p>We were very comfortable with the secondary research, We made a shared google file put everything we think is valuable in it and categorize them into poverty, health care, challenge, education, solution, social science research, technology etc. Those give us a clear overall understanding to homeless problem, we know the demographics of our users. We learn what others did, what they haven’t done, we learn their success and failure. We got inspired by several projects, one is using machine learning algorithm to better predict the trends of homeless problem and there is project organizing bootcamp to teach the homeless into coders, their work greatly broadens our horizons. And the field study was really fun, too. That's the first time I feel so close to customers and get familiar with them. Apart from the project, it's also a brand new experience to talk to the special community which I never got courage to do. I will always remember the feeling when we stood outside the tent shelter area in that beautiful night.</p>
              <p>Things can be improved</p>
              <p>At first we chose to do sharing water tap station to address nutrition problem and dived deeply into it, but it turnt out to be a bad idea in Seattle area. It takes much time which was supposed to be put on our final project. We learnt from that brainstorming part is really important because a good start well paves the road for all the followings. Besides, team communication was not really good, We should have a channel where we can know each other's progress clearly so that the whole project goes on well.</p>
              <p>Prototype</p>
              <p>It's the best practice to test our idea by prototyping. No matter the fidelity is high or low, it's important to let our customers or investors experience the real-object product, through which we can gain trust and real feedback. I believe a successful product is achieved by those who are willing to get their hands dirty.</p>

I finished the design requirements based on our secondary research and field study and gave 5 key technology we probably going to use based on the design requirements.</p></p>

                  <p>Our team chose to focus on nutrition.  At first we were brainstorming a general solution to address nutrition problem like smart cart or smart fridge, later on we found it too broad and not prctical, then we transfered to think of who we serve to converge our scope, the homeless community jumped into our mind. The homeless are neglected by mainstream society, so we decide to design a solution for their benefits.</p>

                  <p>We create a google file named bibliography, and every one of us just put whatever is valuable in the file and categorize them as poverty, health care, challenge, education, solution etc. That gives us motivation to continously do researches and get better understanding of the homeless issue so that we can come up with better idea.Through the rich materials, we get many insights on this community, we learn several key issues existing among them and what other NPO predecessors did before, especially their success and failure. Our final solution takes strength from others' work and aborts weakness, especially a bootcamp training the homeless to become coders gives us inspiration, and the research provides us with clear guidelines to do the following work. Those give us a clear overall understanding to homeless problem, we know the demographics of our users. We learn what others did, what they haven’t done, we learn their success and failure. We got inspired by several projects, one is using machine learning algorithm to better predict the trends of homeless problem and there is project organizing bootcamp to teach the homeless into coders, their work greatly broadens our horizons.</p>

                  <p>That was a beautiful evening, we conducted our street interview on homeless community. For their good, we bought fruit and water to treat them. Of course we were rejected for several times and when we arrived at homeless shlter area, we were so scared that no one wanted to enter so all of us stood outside, deciding what to do. But all efforts paid off, different from online interview, our team got very authentic feedback, revealed many unknowns, and felt familiar with this community.Our interview was based on a set of well-designed questions concerning with their basic information, life and attitudes towards status quo.</p>
                  <p>We grouped the primary needs and observations from these people into a few specific categories: Health, Loss, Technology, Housing, Jobs, Aid, Future, Nutrition, Water, and Substance use. There are large needs in every one of these areas that could each be explored individually in an entire research study. For our insights we hope to focus on those things directly affecting nutrition, from which all of these things are interrelated. We believe that if you were to break down the main barriers currently that are preventing homeless populations from having access to nutritional food, it would fall into education, money, and motivation. Some people are just unaware of what food is best for them to be consuming, but generally this maybe is not the primary reason why there are nutritional problems. Money is obviously a huge factor, but many of these people had enough funds to potentially buy healthy options to eat that they don’t purchase. Ultimately we believe that the biggest current barrier towards nutrition, one that may be hard to understand and analyze because it is so completely interwoven into the complex fabric of reasons that they are currently homeless, is the lack of motivation to live a better and healthier life. Many of these people have given up on that idea that they should pursue the american dream or the pursuit of a long and healthy life. There seems to be a general atmosphere of living life in the present, eating what currently seems best or most fulfilling in that moment. </p>

                  <p>We designed the whole work flow of our mobile application by paper prototype, it serves as a usability testing technique and helps us to communicate ideas. Generally speaking, the different screens are sketched prior to the testing. Typical use cases are then created and the users are requested to try and perform them by interacting with the prototype. Based on where they press or select, the human computer will change or alter the prototype by introducing whole screens or snippets, depending on how the system is intended to react. As you will notice, sometimes the facilitator and the human computer is the same person, thus creating the wrong impression that the human computer is speaking during the usability testing session. It is very important that these sessions are well documented using a video camera in order to be able to assess user reactions after the test. </p>
